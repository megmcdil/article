<div class="text">
	<p>When Dom Yodice heard that the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus was shutting down, he said, “I ran the full cycle of emotions — sadness, anger, frustration. I didn’t believe it possible it would no longer be around.”

He’s seen the Ringling circus more than 100 times, starting when he was 6 and lived in Brooklyn. His parents took him to Madison Square Garden. Many years he went three or four times, sitting in different sections to get a fresh angle on the acts. “I’d sit on the bottom, then I’d sit on the top, then I’d sit on the end,” he said. “Wherever I sat, it was amazing.”

But there are fewer people around who are captivated by lion tamers and wire walkers. Costs are rising — Ringling’s two troupes, known as the Blue Unit and the Red Unit, rumble from city to city on mile-long trains. And ticket sales are flagging. Opposition from animal rights groups led to the erasure of the show’s signature elephants last year.

Given those challenges, Ringling will play four more months, including a run in Brooklyn starting in late February. It will hold its final performance on May 21 at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., on Long Island, before lapsing into memory.

For such a nomadic operation, Ringling has an elongated history with New York, stretching back to that indelible huckster, P. T. Barnum. Born in Connecticut in 1810, he moved to New York in 1834 and was soon pitching preposterous hoaxes. The first was Joice Heth, a blind slave who was supposedly the 161-year-old nursemaid of George Washington. New Yorkers paid to listen to her fanciful stories about young George.

Across several decades, Barnum operated the American Museum on Lower Broadway in Manhattan, crammed with acts like Gen. Tom Thumb, an entertainer who had dwarfism; a dog running a loom; and the Feejee Mermaid, which was actually a monkey sewn to a fish. Then, in 1870 at age 60, Barnum, in collaboration with partners, started P. T. Barnum’s Grand Traveling Museum, Menagerie, Caravan and Hippodrome. It made its debut on a Brooklyn lot in April 1871. Attractions included elephants, camels, yaks, an armless girl, a perpetual motion machine and Admiral Dot, a performer who had dwarfism. It later merged with the circus of James Anthony Bailey to become the Barnum and Bailey Circus.

One night in 1884, P. T. Barnum paraded 21 circus elephants, including the storied Jumbo, and 17 camels across the Brooklyn Bridge to prove its strength, which made for great publicity for the circus.

<p>

Once the Ringling brothers, who had their own circus, bought the Barnum and Bailey circus and merged them, the first combined performance was in 1919 at Madison Square Garden.

Those were other days, and these days, longtime circus fans in and around the city have been feeling bereft.
